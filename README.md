# TreasureQuest
MY FINAL CPT for GRADE 12

Disclaimer: There may be a few bugs since the project is no longer in development.
Java

Features:
- Host game
- Join game
- In-game chatbox (overlay)
- INSANE UI graphics (at least for a grade 12 school CPT)
- Simplistic interface and controls

If you'd like to play the game, you can find the JAR file in the "\release" folder.

Notice: On macOS or OS X, use arrow keys to move.
Also notice: There are no folders because my teammates wanted all data in the home directory (what?????).

Similar to "Enter The Gungeon", your player will be centered on the screen, and will look in the direction of your crosshair.
