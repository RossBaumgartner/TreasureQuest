# TreasureQuest
MY FINAL CPT for GRADE 12

Disclaimer: There may be a few bugs since the project is no longer in development.
Java

Features:
- Host game
- Join game
- In-game chatbox (overlay)
- INSANE UI graphics (at least for a grade 12 school CPT)
- Simplistic interface and controls

If you'd like to play the game, you can find the JAR file in the "\release" folder.

Notice: On macOS or OS X, use arrow keys to move.
Also notice: There are no folders because my teammates wanted all data in the home directory (what?????).
