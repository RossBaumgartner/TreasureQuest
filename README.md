# TreasureQuest
FINAL NETWORKING CPT for GRADE 12, worked with Mogen Cheng and Mark Abadir on this project. At the time, we did not use github.

(This was programmed before we had learned object oriented, and does not represent our programming skill today, but at the time of
creating this game it was a great feat for us with out high school level programming experience.)

Disclaimer: There may be a few bugs since the project is no longer in development.
Java

Features:
- Host game
- Join game
- In-game chatbox (overlay)
- INSANE UI graphics (at least for a grade 12 school CPT)
- Simplistic interface and controls

If you'd like to play the game, you can find the JAR file in the "\release" folder.

Notice: On macOS or OS X, use arrow keys to move.
Also notice: There are no folders because we were naive at the time of how many files the game would contain.

Similar to "Enter The Gungeon", your player will be centered on the screen, and will look in the direction of your crosshair.
